■ Overview
This repository documents my research work as an Undergraduate Researcher in the U.S. CMS
PURSUE Program at Fermilab (2025). My projects focused on Distributed High-Performance
Computing (HPC), AI-driven CI/CD automation, and enhancements to scientific software systems
supporting the CMS experiment at CERN.
■ Research Focus
• Containerization & Automation: Developed and deployed workflows using Podman and OpenStack
Fermicloud, enabling scalable, reproducible environments.
• CI/CD for Scientific Computing: Wrote shell scripts and integrated unit tests to automate continuous
integration pipelines.
• GlideinWMS Enhancement: Contributed to the GlideinWMS codebase, adding Google-style
docstrings, unit tests, and documentation for maintainability.
